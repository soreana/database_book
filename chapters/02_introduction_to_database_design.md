# Introduction to Database Design

## Definitions

* **Entity Relationship** :

    The entity relationship (ER) data model allows us to describe the data involved in a real-world enterprise in terms 
    of objects and their relationships and is widely used to develop an initial database design. An entity is described 
    using a set of attributes. All entities in a given entity set have the same attributes; this is what we mean by similar. 
    For each attribute associated with an entity set, we must identify a domain of possible values. For example, the 
    domain associated with the attribute name of Employees might be the set of 20-character strings.
    
* **Entity** :

    An entity is an object in the real world that is distinguishable from other objects.
    
* **Entity Set** :

    It is often useful to identify a collection of similar entities. Such a collection is called an entity set.
    
* **Attribute**:

* **Key and Primary Key**:
    
    A key is a minimal set of attributes whose values uniquely identify an entity in the set. For each entity set, we 
    choose a key. There could be more than one candidate key; if so, we designate one of them as the primary key.
